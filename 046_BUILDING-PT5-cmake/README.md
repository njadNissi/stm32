# Manage project with CMake

**NOTE!:** I have a new repository for [stm32-cmake](https://github.com/prtzl/stm32-cmake) which is updated and is going to be the reference in future videos.

You will need the following tools in your path:

```shell
cmake
make
gcc-arm-none-eabi (with C++ headers and stdlib)
```
